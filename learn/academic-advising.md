# ⏳ Academic Advising

## First Year Students and Focus Areas <a href="#block-32fc92124125420490218aa8362baf9a" id="block-32fc92124125420490218aa8362baf9a"></a>

Incoming students must select a focus area or a major before they may enroll in courses. Focus Areas are not permanent, and they provide students with a flexible way to discover the right major.

To help you with your planning process, please see the following diagram, which depicts which courses you might want to take, depending on the focus area you select. Try to take all of the "core" courses and pick add-ons (marked with + signs) if you wish to focus in Business or STEM fields. You can use the diagram for your planning purposes if you wish (see [duplicating files in Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511533-Duplicate-or-copy-files)).

Note: foreign language study is possible in every focus area, as it is a General Education requirement. Sometimes, the DegreeWorks course scheduling system will flag students who enroll in their first language course. In almost all cases, this should be corrected with a **manual override** by the University Registrar (see also [What is a Focus Area?](https://advising.kennesaw.edu/college\_advising\_centers/owladvising/focus\_area.php)).

KSU German Studies Majors graduate ahead of schedule with study and work abroad.
{% endhint %}

The Department of World Languages and Cultures offers a B.A. program in Modern Language & Culture, and German students have the option to specialize in German and another language. This program is dynamic, and offers students the opportunity to enroll in at home or abroad, earning credit hours at German learning institutes or through German work experiences. Majors diversify their knowledge and experience through a combination of general education coursework, free electives, language study, upper-division related studies courses, internships, and/or study abroad experiences. We recommend that students pursue study abroad each summer, schedules permitting.
