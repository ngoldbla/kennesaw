# WLC 2306

## About the Seminar

This course offers a passport into the hidden world of dissent. Here, we bear witness to artâ€™s extraordinary capacity to challenge tyranny and empower the persecuted. Together, we will trace a legacy of courage that still echoes, calling us to lives of freedom and fearless creativity. We will traverse the world's continents in this seminar, and give voice to non-canonical authors and artists of Europe, Central and South America, Africa, West Asia, and South and East Asia.

## Getting to Know Each Other

Next semester, your guide will be Dr. Dylan Goldblatt (Ph.D., Germanic Languages and Literatures; Graduate Certificate in Comparative Literature). Before coming to KSU, Dr. Goldblatt lived in Europe and Asia. He is also a researcher in the field of Law in Literature.

We are thrilled to hear about your interest in this first-of-its-kind academic journey into the modern history of artistic dissent. Explore this rich literary and artistic theme of resistance next semester, and learn to create and speak truth for yourself.
