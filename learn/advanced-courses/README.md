# ðŸŽ“ Advanced Courses

In your German classes, you'll get a handy guide that tells you what you'll learn and how you'll be graded. Read it well and keep it close. Remember, success comes with a positive mindset and doing your best.

## Be Ready

Be ready for class. Do your homework in a quiet place, free from distractions. Set time aside regularly to do homework. Think of it this way: for each credit, you'll need two hours of homework every week. So, a three-credit course means nine hours a week: three for class and six for homework. Remember, less time means less learning.

When you have reading homework, take your time. Write notes, think about the themes, and try to understand more than just the words. Reading often in German will help you a lot. Be thorough with your writing assignments and finish them on time. Check your own work before you turn it in. Use the required books, especially the ones on grammar and dictionaries. Keep a notebook, pen, pencil, calendar, and a folder for class materials. Maybe get a German-German dictionary someday.

Pay full attention in class. Turn off your phones and other gadgets. Come early, get set up, and start work on time. Be ready to work with your classmates and professors. Join group activities, communicate in German, and do your best. Remember, practice is key to mastering a language.

Some classes will have lectures. Come ready to take notes. Keep them organized and use them for review. Make friends with your classmates and professors. If you have questions or need help, visit your professors during their office hours. They're always ready to help.

Remember, class is just one way to learn German at KSU. Try to practice speaking, listening, and reading outside of class too.

## How to Read a Text

You'll read a lot in your German classes. Here are some tips:

1. Find a quiet place.
2. Give yourself enough time to read carefully.
3. Keep a steady pace. If you don't understand something, read it again before looking up words.
4. Be active while reading. Take notes and mark your texts.
5. Don't exhaust yourself. If you're too tired to concentrate, take a break.

## How to Annotate a Text

Don't be shy to write in your books. Your notes will always be with you this way. For non-fiction, mark the main points and summarize arguments. For fiction, list characters and track elements that you find interesting. Engage with the text, predict what will happen next, ask questions, or even imagine conversations with the characters. Mark unfamiliar words to look them up later.
