Learning German isn't just about textbooks, it's also about diving into German culture. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Music & Movies**: Get hooked to German music and films. Use platforms like Spotify and YouTube. Sing along to your favorite German songs - it's a fun way to learn!
2. **News**: Read online German newspapers and magazines. Google can help you find popular ones like Der Spiegel and Die Zeit.
3. **Books**: Try German books, or even translations of your favorites. Check out websites like Amazon.de or abebooks.com to find them.
4. **Radio & TV**: Listen to German radio stations online and watch German television like Deutsche Welle (viewable in the WLRC). Some news shows like Die Tagesschau offer slower versions, which can be helpful for beginners.
5. **Streaming Services**: Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime offer German-language movies and shows. Some even have German subtitles or are dubbed in German. You can also access a free Mediathek site for a broadcaster (such as ARD, ZDF, RTL, SAT1, 3SAT, or ProSieben). Paid German streaming is available through [youtv.de](http://youtv.de/).
6. **Apps**: Install apps like Zeit Online or DW on your phone or tablet for news updates in German.
7. **Social Networks**: Connect with German speakers online. It's a great way to practice your language skills.
8. **Change Your Settings**: Consider changing your phone or social media language settings to German. It's a cool daily immersion trick!

Remember, learning is best when you're enjoying yourself. Share what you learn with your friends, keep a German journal, and build a personal German vocabulary notebook. It's more fun to learn together!

1. **GRMN Courses**: KSU courses focus on things that are harder to learn by yourself, like German history, literature, and advanced grammar. Enjoy these subjects and connect them with German culture outside the class. You'll also get a chance to polish your formal writing and technical vocabulary. But remember, fun activities like music, movies, or casual chats in German are for your free time, not the main focus in class.
2. **Speaking Partner**: Stop by the World Language Resource Center to chat in German about anything that interests you. It's a great way to practice.
3. **Co-curricular Activities**: There are plenty of chances to use German outside the class. These help you practice speaking and listening and learn more about German life and culture. Plus, you'll meet students with the same goals as you.
   1. Join the [**Peer Buddy Program**](../explore/peer-buddy-program.md) and attach to a German speaking partner in the area.
   2. Attend the Kaffeestunde to practice your spoken German.
   3. Attend guest lectures and musical performances related to German on campus.
   4. Attend off-campus events and trips.
   5. Seek out international students from German-speaking countries and befriend them.
   6. Watch German films shown on campus, at Filmabend, or at the [**Atlanta Film Festival**](https://www.atlantafilmfestival.com/).
   7. Become active in the [**German Club**](../explore/german-club.md)
