The German Schoolf of Atlanta (GSA) was buzzing with activity right before Halloween! KSU German professors Drs. Smith and Goldblatt visited the East Cobb Middle School campus over the weekend to teach lessons about the environment and sustainability in German to speakers and learners of all ages! #HuggableHoneybee #Lernvergnuegen @GermanschoolATL #kennesawstateuniversity @GermanyinUSA.

Special thanks to Susanne Estrella for organizing and coordinating the event in her dual role with Kennesaw State University and the GSA. We were also proud to work with student volunteers Luke Kirkley (Treasurer, KSU German Club) and Mayra Klein (CBYX / PPP)!
