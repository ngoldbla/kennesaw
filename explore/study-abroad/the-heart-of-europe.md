Limited to a total of 30 KSU students in virtual modality and to 20 KSU students as actual short-term study abroad, this generously grant-funded program is especially for learners who are not yet ready for international travel. Anchored at the European Academy in Otzenhausen, the program introduces topics of general interest to KSU students who join, for several days, students from Spain, Germany, and Russia to explore current issues across cultures. Sessions will be in English. Successful participants will earn 1-3 KSU course credits (tuition not covered by grant) and a certificate from the Academy (a nice resume entry!); program cost for traveling students is $ 1,750 (without airfare and tuition) and will be supported with $2,000/each. Open to all students.
