## Planning <a href="#block-4a5233e554524d65b27799a177e23402" id="block-4a5233e554524d65b27799a177e23402"></a>

Study abroad to Paderborn requires substantial planning in advance, but if you follow these simple steps, you will be fine and well-prepared. Note: You will need to discuss your plans with KSU German faculty, your academic Major Advisor, and KSU Education Abroad.

* **Timing**. Will you go abroad for a semester or a year? Note that German university schedules are _not_ fall and spring, but rather winter and summer. For this reason, single semester exchange students should depart in Spring. Academic year exchange students should depart in Fall.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For one semester, leave in Spring. For two semesters, leave in Fall.
{% endhint %}

* **Financial Support**. In most cases, students will be able to apply their financial aid package from KSU toward their study abroad experience for an academic semester or year. Seek financial aid expertise from that office in order to clarify the terms of support. It is also important to take note of your recurring expenses in the US and wind them down.

{% hint style="info" %}
Set an appointment with a KSU Financial Aid advisor to clarify your support in advance.
{% endhint %}

* **Academic Advising**. In preparation for your study abroad experience, book appointments to meet with your German faculty advisor, your Education Abroad advisor, and any Academic Advisor that you have (for another major) at KSU. It is important to coordinate with these three parties so that you ensure the courses you take abroad fit into your plan to progress.
