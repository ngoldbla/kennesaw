The German Club of Kennesaw State University is a German language and culture club that welcomes all who are interested in learning about German culture, customs, and practicing conversational German. Members need not speak German and are not required to be enrolled in courses of German at any level. Students who attend the German club meetings will be exposed to various German customs as well as to the language.
