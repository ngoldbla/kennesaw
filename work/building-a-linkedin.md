## Checklist <a href="#block-2e30f244a85d43d89b927ded92bab2bd" id="block-2e30f244a85d43d89b927ded92bab2bd"></a>

* Do you have the perfect **profile photo** (headshot, smiling, correct attire)?
* Does your **headline** match your desired job title?
* Does your **summary** include both keywords + accomplishments?
* Does your work **experience** include your resume bullets?
* Does your **education** include your accomplishments outside of class?
* Do your skills match the desired **skills** on your dream job description?
* Do you have at least one **recommendation**?

## Profile Photo <a href="#block-daf7bd9feb43498cb53e7aab6999baa9" id="block-daf7bd9feb43498cb53e7aab6999baa9"></a>

Finding a stellar image for your Linkedin profile is critical, because recruiters and colleagues will see your contact data in a small format, so that image itself may be the only legible part of your profile in some instances!

* People love faces, so crop yours around your head & shoulders. Face forward with no one else in the frame.
* People love smiles - so make sure you have a genuine one.
* People love people like themselves - so match your desired industry’s dress code (e.g., casual for tech, formal for finance).

## Headline <a href="#block-25164a6b680a4c37a5c31f8890d58e08" id="block-25164a6b680a4c37a5c31f8890d58e08"></a>

Recruiters search LinkedIn by position titles (for example: “Supply Chain Director,” “Product Marketing Manager,” “Translator”). So make sure that your headline reflects what you want them to discover you for:

* If you have experience with the job you want, feel free to use the actual job title.
* If you don’t have experience, you can add a modifier like “Aspiring Product Marketing Manager.”

## Summary <a href="#block-b555eeae8f08442dac82fe635bceee6a" id="block-b555eeae8f08442dac82fe635bceee6a"></a>

Your summary can do double duty for you. Linkedin employees advise that the usage of specific keywords makes it 40x more likely to be contacted about opportunities.

* Having the right keywords from your desired job description (e.g. SEO, PR, NLP) can get you discovered by recruiters.
* Listening significant and concrete accomplishments can make it easy for recruiters to pick you.

## Experience <a href="#block-86c94beaefab4509a096d1e65eafd3ff" id="block-86c94beaefab4509a096d1e65eafd3ff"></a>

Most people assume they shouldn’t put their resume bullets online. This is a huge mistake for a few reasons. (And the only exception would be work performed under non-disclosure.)

* It means you can’t be found for all t he great keywords in the “Description” part of your profile (e.g. “positioning”).
* It also means that you can’t show off all the great, specific work that you’ve done.

## Education <a href="#block-6c17ee69a16247b3bf19431638c115ad" id="block-6c17ee69a16247b3bf19431638c115ad"></a>

Don’t assume employers only care about your degree. Savvy LinkedIn users know that what they did in school is just as important & says a lot about who they are. Include:

* Any jobs you held while enrolled.
* Extracurricular leadership.
* Volunteer duties (40% of employers say these are equal to paid work).
* Relevant courses, projects & publications (especially for new grads).

## Skills <a href="#block-81ae9a3b9ff84e61b072cf5fd5ecd0eb" id="block-81ae9a3b9ff84e61b072cf5fd5ecd0eb"></a>

Most people just go with whatever random skills their friends have recommended for them. This can be optimized.

* Choose your own skills! Don’t waste a good opportunity to display the skills from your dream job description.
* Just don’t worry about endorsements - recruiters don’t care about them because they can be gamed.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27288%27%20height=%27435.42857142857144%27/%3e)![image](https://kennesaw.de/\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.super.so%2F4f2098f8-aad1-4d5b-be68-fc6fbcd07b1d%2Fimages%2Fb4055ee3-74a6-4c44-9e8d-7e128708cccf%2FScreen\_Shot\_2022-05-19\_at\_8.03.27\_PM.png\&w=640\&q=80)

## Recommendations <a href="#block-8ac6a9b4f68c4c9c926d9ea20bed8b1b" id="block-8ac6a9b4f68c4c9c926d9ea20bed8b1b"></a>

Unlike endorsements, recommendations do matter. Without them, recruiters have to take your word. It’s validation.

* Even one recommendation says “OK, this is someone you can trust.”
* Try to get at least one recommendation for each job you list (even if from a peer).
