# üì© Letters of Recommendation

<details>

<summary>Requesting Letters from Faculty</summary>

Occasionally, students require letters for graduate programs and applications to special opportunities. An effective letter of recommendation provides a portrait of who you are beyond your college grades or entrance exam scores. Admissions committees rely on letter of recommendations not only to validate what you have written in your application, but also to gather information about your personality, character, and motivation for your chosen field. Note: The guidance here replicates content from [Harvard FAS Career Services](https://ocs.fas.harvard.edu/letters-recommendation).

### Before Asking for a Letter <a href="#block-dcba7017594b403290920c52c1f97603" id="block-dcba7017594b403290920c52c1f97603"></a>

Before approaching faculty for letters of recommendation, reflect on how these letters can strengthen your application.

* List the qualities that the graduate program is looking for in an applicant. To get a sense of what an employer or graduate school is looking for in a candidate, think about who succeeds in the program or job you are seeking.
* Who can positively comment on these relevant personal qualities?
* If you need to provide several letters of recommendation, consider how each letter can fill different needs and request letters from individuals who know you in different contexts and can comment on different strengths.
* What would you like someone to include/address in the letter that may be missing in the rest of your application? Who can comment on your professional behavior? Your maturity? Did you take a particularly challenging sequence of courses that is not necessarily obvious from your transcript? Are there extenuating circumstances that might account for atypical grades?
* Decide whether you want to waive your right to see the letter of recommendation. For most employers and graduate programs, confidential letters have greater credibility and are assigned greater weight in the application process. Interestingly, many letter writers are less inhibited in praising an applicant when the letter is confidential!
* Allow plenty of ‚Äúturnaround time.‚Äù Be sure the letter writer has the opportunity to write a thoughtful, complete letter without worrying about an unrealistic deadline.

### When Asking for a Letter <a href="#block-19bc47b972594d5ebaa1c1bd762e95c1" id="block-19bc47b972594d5ebaa1c1bd762e95c1"></a>

After deciding which individuals can provide the most positive and complete picture of your relevant skills, experiences, and character traits, communicate with each of the potential writers.

* Ask the letter writer if they feel comfortable writing a letter to support your application. If they seem hesitant or ambivalent, thank them for their time but do not request a letter from this individual. It is crucial that the person writing your letter is positive about your application and conveys that in their letter. If a letter is lukewarm or negative, it can reflect poorly on your ability to judge how you appear to others as well as give the employer or graduate program feedback that you did not intend to convey.

* The letter of recommendation will be especially effective if the writers describe specific examples and instances whenever possible. So, provide each letter writer with information relevant to your experience and application. This could be a resume, a personal statement, a reminder of particular incidents or discussions, etc. Spend some time discussing with the letter writer how this information relates to your application.

Don't forget to thank the person writing your letter by sending a thank-you note! Let them know the outcome of your application! Not only could their letter make the difference in whether or not you are accepted, you most likely will want to ask for letters again in the future.

### Write Letters that Make a Difference <a href="#block-d9010bdea3b246f2aaf41ac9ab3ddf18" id="block-d9010bdea3b246f2aaf41ac9ab3ddf18"></a>

The guidelines are intended to enhance the letter-writing process by providing a general framework of best practices and relevant content for letter writers to follow. Student success takes many forms, and these letter-writing scaffolds are meant to support placement success. Before you start ensure that the student has consulted. Note: The guidance here replicates original content created by the [AAMC](https://www.aamc.org/system/files?file=2019-09%2Flettersguidelinesbrochure.pdf).

* Provide an accurate assessment of the applicant‚Äôs suitability for the given program rather than advocate for the applicant.
* Briefly explain your relationship with the applicant:
  * How long have you known the applicant?
  * In what capacity have you interacted (e.g., faculty, advisor, supervisor)?
  * Are your observations of the applicant direct or indirect?
  * Quality of information is more important than letter length.&#x20;
* Focus on the applicant rather than details of the lab, course, assignment, job, or institution

<!---->

* Only include information on grades, GPA, ACTFL, or GRE scores _if_ you also provide context to help interpret them. Grades, GPA, ACTFL, and GRE scores are available within the application.
* Focus on behaviors you have observed directly when describing an applicant‚Äôs suitability for graduate school. Consider describing:&#x20;
  * The situation or context of the behaviors.
  * The actual behaviors you observed.
  * Any consequences of the behaviors.
* Ask the applicant for permission if you plan to include any information that could be considered potentially private or sensitive.
* Consider including unique contributions that an applicant would bring to a graduate cohort:
  * Obstacles that the applicant had to overcome and how those obstacles have led to new learning and growth.
  * Contributions that an applicant would bring to a medical school‚Äôs diversity, broadly defined (e.g., background, attributes, experiences).
* Committees find comparison information helpful. If you make comparisons, be sure to provide context. Include information about the comparison group (e.g., students in a class you taught, students in your department, co-workers) and tour rationale for the comparison.
