# ðŸ”¬ Research Projects

## Join our Research Lab

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="About" %}
In 2023 Dr. Goldblatt inaugurated the OWLLLM Lab at KSU. OWLLM combines Owl and LLM because it brings together KSU Owls and LLM technology. The lab name is also an acronym for **O**ptimizing **W**ord **L**earning via **L**arge **L**anguage **M**odels, which is the focus of its research. This research exists to facilitate student success in language education at KSU, where the curriculum emphasizes the learning and retention of high frequency vocabulary in support of rapid second language acquisition.

Currently, Dr. Goldblatt is recruiting students for the following OWLLLM project:

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM) as Learning Supports for Second Language Acquisition (SLA)**

This undergraduate research project will explore the potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) to support second language learning and instruction. As AI and natural language processing advance rapidly, there is great interest in how these technologies could be leveraged to enhance language learning outcomes and experiences. Our team of undergraduate researchers from linguistics and literature backgrounds will conduct a literature review, propose use cases, and potentially build prototypes to demonstrate the value of AI/LLMs in this domain.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Faculty" %}
The Primary Investigator (PI) of the OWLLM Lab is Dr. Dylan Goldblatt.

* Delivered digital pedagogy workshops on topics like gamification, ePortfolios, and workflows for faculty and grad students at University of Virginia (2013)
* Expertise in narrative, German cinema, and interactive media to inform hypermedia development and analysis for this project
* Chaired "Interactive Digital Narratives" panel and presented theories of mediated encounter at International Conference on Narrative at MIT (2014)
* Collaborated on iterative improvements to email drafting and web articles for L2 learning, published in academic journals (2007-2009)
* Opened and digitized language learning through projects like the open textbook _Der und mehr_ (2020) and as Co-PI on an NSF Cyberlearning grant application
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Students" %}
**Responsibilities**

Weekly duties will vary by project phase. Students can expect to participate in the following:

1. Background research on AI/LLMs and their capabilities for language tasks
2. Literature review on existing work applying AI/LLMs to language learning
3. Brainstorming and prototyping possible AI applications and learning interactions
4. User testing and evaluation of prototypes (time permitting)
5. Analysis and writeup of findings
6. Preparation of conference presentation.

**Funding**

Undergraduates in the First-Year Scholars Program earn stipends for **up to $2,000** for the first academic year in the lab. There is an additional extension program that students can apply for, and that extension is granted based on successful completion of all project milestones in the first year.

**Outcomes**

Students will conduct this start-to-finish research project and in doing so will build valuable skills for in project management, analysis, software development, language assessment, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. These include:

Content-Based Outcomes - definitions of LLM/AI terms, improved understanding of linguistics; understanding of prior work through literature review, articulation of the study and its contributions to the field.

Skill-Based Outcomes - design a study to answer a research question, develop a hypothesis, write a research paper, present their research to an audience (e.g., poster)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Eligibility

* Students must be in their first year of college at KSU with fewer than 30 transfer credits (not including AP and dual enrollment credits).
* To remain in the First-Year Scholars Program in the Spring, students must be enrolled in classes and in good academic standing.
* To receive stipend payments each semester, students in the First-Year Scholars Program are expected to participate in mandatory orientation meetings, as well as attend events and/or workshops hosted by the Office of Undergraduate Research and Peer Mentors.
* The project will be presented at the Symposium of Student Scholars in April.
* Progress Reports and end of semester evaluation forms will be submitted on time to the Office of Undergraduate Research.

### How to Apply

The Officer of Undergraduate Research at KSU provides stipends in support of research training for first year students who meet certain criteria. Applications to work with specific labs go through the Office of Undergraduate Research. _If you are reading this on or after September 14, 2023, please be aware that the deadline for applications to the First-Year Scholars Program has passed._
