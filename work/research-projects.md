In 2023 Dr. Goldblatt inaugurated  **Saga** at KSU. This research lab exists to facilitate student success in language education at KSU, where the curriculum emphasizes the learning and retention of high frequency vocabulary in support of rapid second language acquisition.&#x20;

Currently, Dr. Goldblatt is leading students on the following project:

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM) as Learning Supports for Second Language Acquisition (SLA)**

This undergraduate research project will explore the potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) to support second language learning and instruction. As AI and natural language processing advance rapidly, there is great interest in how these technologies could be leveraged to enhance language learning outcomes and experiences. Our team of undergraduate researchers from linguistics and literature backgrounds will conduct a literature review, propose use cases, and potentially build prototypes to demonstrate the value of AI/LLMs in this domain.

Visit us at [**sagalabs.org**](https://www.sagalabs.org) for more information and to follow us for updates.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Apply" %}
**Application**

The application for AY 2023-24 is now closed. Please contact Dr. Goldblatt to express informal interest and stay in the loop for opportunities as they arise.

**Responsibilities**

Weekly duties will vary by project phase. Students can expect to participate in the following:

1. Background research on AI/LLMs and their capabilities for language tasks
2. Literature review on existing work applying AI/LLMs to language learning
3. Brainstorming and prototyping possible AI applications and learning interactions
4. User testing and evaluation of prototypes (time permitting)
5. Analysis and writeup of findings
6. Preparation of conference presentation.

**Funding**

Undergraduates in the First-Year Scholars Program earn stipends for **up to $2,000** for the first academic year in the lab. There is an additional extension program that students can apply for, and that extension is granted based on successful completion of all project milestones in the first year.

**Outcomes**

Students will conduct this start-to-finish research project and in doing so will build valuable skills for in project management, analysis, software development, language assessment, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. These include:

Content-Based Outcomes - definitions of LLM/AI terms, improved understanding of linguistics; understanding of prior work through literature review, articulation of the study and its contributions to the field.

Skill-Based Outcomes - design a study to answer a research question, develop a hypothesis, write a research paper, present their research to an audience (e.g., poster)

**Eligibility**

First-year Scholars

* Students must be in their first year of college at KSU with fewer than 30 transfer credits (not including AP and dual enrollment credits).
* To remain in the First-Year Scholars Program in the Spring, students must be enrolled in classes and in good academic standing.
* To receive stipend payments each semester, students in the First-Year Scholars Program are expected to participate in mandatory orientation meetings, as well as attend events and/or workshops hosted by the Office of Undergraduate Research and Peer Mentors.
* The project will be presented at the Symposium of Student Scholars in April.
* Progress Reports and end of semester evaluation forms will be submitted on time to the Office of Undergraduate Research.

All KSU Students

* Students must demonstrate academic achievement, efficient time management, and clarity of digital and face-to-face communication.
* To join the lab, students will perform domain-specific research and apply for grants to fund their participation.
* To continue with the lab, students must achieve milestones as scheduled and pursue research assignments and professional development opportunities as provided.

In 2023 Dr. Smith inaugurated the OWLS-CARE Lab at KSU. OWLS-CARE connects OWLS and CARE because it brings together KSU Owls and the intentional act of caring for and about your leadership skills through exploration and practice. The lab name is also an acronym for **O**ptimizing **W**ith **L**eadership **S**kills: **C**areer **A**dvancement **R**esources **E**xplored, which is the focus of its research. This research exists to facilitate student success in undergraduate education at KSU, where the curriculum emphasizes the development of critical career competencies and leadership skills.

Visit us at [**owls.care**](https://owls.care) for more information and to follow us for updates.

{% tab title="Projects" %}
Currently, Dr. Smith is recruiting students for the following OWLS-CARE projects:

**Leadership Skills as Career Competencies: Intentional Practice of Communication in Teams** &#x20;

This undergraduate research project explores how intentional practice of communication in teams supports critical leadership skills as career competencies. Student success in navigating project-based teamwork is of great interest to educators and employers. As demographics in local and international work environments diversify, there is need to learn and practice how we communicate with one another to get the job done. Our team/s of undergraduate researchers will prepare for a transnational seminar in Spring 2024 hosted at KSU by researching, proposing, and potentially implementing community-based projects. Project completion in teams will demonstrate the value of understanding and practicing critical communication skills as well as career competencies identified by [ACTFL](https://edtochangetheworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/21century\_worldlanguagesmap.pdf) and [NACE](https://www.naceweb.org/uploadedFiles/files/2021/resources/nace-career-readiness-competencies-revised-apr-2021.pdf).&#x20;

#### Arolsen Group: Rethinking the Past – Digital Archives, Restitution and the Culture of Remembrance <a href="#arolsen-group-rethinking-the-past-e2-80-93-digital-archives-restitution-and-the-culture-of-remembran" id="arolsen-group-rethinking-the-past-e2-80-93-digital-archives-restitution-and-the-culture-of-remembran"></a>

Engage with student peers from KSU, Germany, Austria, and the UK to discuss critical issues in the Humanities and Social Sciences, such as digitization in archives and museums, and ethics of commemorating the past. Identify and research local sites or objects in your community and explore how the past is integrated into lived current culture. Or: Trace an object and its history in collaboration with Germany’s Arolsen Archives, the International Center on Nazi Persecution, and explore how to deal with the legacy of WW2 in terms of remembrance and digitalization

#### Student Success at KSU: A Comparative Study of German Learners of English  <a href="#student-success-at-ksu-a-comparative-study-of-german-learners-of-english" id="student-success-at-ksu-a-comparative-study-of-german-learners-of-english"></a>

Each year, KSU hosts cohorts of young Germans and KSU students’ lives are enriched by their presence on campus. Join us in a study of this experience by developing fundamental research skills as you assist KSU scholars in a quasi-experimental research design of a mixed-method study. Interested in finding out how international students fare at KSU and how to conduct quantitative and qualitative research by analyzing data from surveys and focus groups? This Project is for you!

#### Emergent Leaders in Glocal Partnerships: Critical Issues in Cultures and Communities <a href="#emergent-leaders-in-glocal-partnerships-critical-issues-in-cultures-and-communities" id="emergent-leaders-in-glocal-partnerships-critical-issues-in-cultures-and-communities"></a>

You’ve been told you are a “born leader”? Or a “perfect teamplayer”? Join us to find out what may be hidden behind these labels for leadership styles and practices. We study the complex systems undergirding often not-so-smooth operations, as well as the processes entailed in getting work done – ideally to the satisfaction of all involved. From identifying your own strengths and needs-improvement skills to recognizing in others preferred (cultural) ways of addressing tasks, this project moves you toward finding and advancing your own leadership skills.
