If youâ€™re interested in specific companies, look for vacancies directly on their corporate websites.

## **Write an Application** <a href="#block-a82e32fadecb49aea527485c19d572f1" id="block-a82e32fadecb49aea527485c19d572f1"></a>

Normally, an application to a German company includes a covering letter, a CV with a photograph, certificates and testimonials. Make sure you have the required qualifications and emphasise them in your covering letter.

## **Apply for a Visa** <a href="#block-26be156ede5a453ca19c669cb4a9983a" id="block-26be156ede5a453ca19c669cb4a9983a"></a>

American citizens can enter Germany without a visa and remain for up to three months. If you want to work here, however, you will need to apply for a residence permit that allows you to take up gainful employment. You should only apply for one when you already have a contract of employment in Germany.

Make an appointment at the German Consulate in Atlanta and inform your future employer that it can take some time before all visa formalities are completed. If you have a higher education qualification that is recognized in Germany (e.g., B.A. or B.S. from KSU), you can receive a six-month visa to look for a job.

## **Obtain Insurance** <a href="#block-7923f731eef24204b03de4403f3d8ee7" id="block-7923f731eef24204b03de4403f3d8ee7"></a>

Health and personal liability insurances are mandatory in Germany, and that applies from the first day of your stay.
